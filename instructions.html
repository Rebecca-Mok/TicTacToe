                <ol>
                    <li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
                    <li>You are X and the computer is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</li>
                    <li>The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</li>
                    <li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>** If you would like to reset the score board, click home and restart the game.</p>
